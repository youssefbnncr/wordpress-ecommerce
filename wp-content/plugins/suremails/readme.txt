With SureMail, emails are sent using your chosen SMTP provider’s API, bypassing potential issues like blocked SMTP ports or poor email deliverability. Whether you’re using your hosting provider’s SMTP service or a third-party provider, SureMail ensures your emails always reach their destination.

SureMail supports multiple SMTP providers:

1. Amazon SES

### Multiple SMTP Connections

SureMail allows you to configure multiple SMTP connections with the same From Email and From Name, ensuring your emails are sent through the most reliable channels. If your primary provider faces issues, SureMail can seamlessly switch to an alternate connection, maintaining the continuity of your email flow. This redundancy means you don’t have to worry about downtime or failed deliveries, keeping your communications running smoothly at all times.

### Multiple Fallback Email Connections

With SureMail, you’re never limited to a single SMTP connection. If your primary email provider fails, SureMail automatically switches to your fallback connections one after another, ensuring your emails still reach their destination. This fail-safe feature guarantees reliable email delivery, even in situations where the first connection fails, keeping your business communication uninterrupted.

### Auto-Retry Mechanism

SureMail includes a built-in auto-retry mechanism that ensures emails are resent in case of failure. If an email fails to send through your primary SMTP connection and its fallbacks, SureMail will retry sending the email after a set period, giving your delivery another chance. This increases your chances of successful delivery without requiring you to manually intervene, reducing email failures and improving reliability.

### Detailed Email Logging

SureMail provides detailed email logging, so you can easily monitor the status of every email you send. View detailed logs to track delivery statuses, troubleshoot any issues, and keep a record of every sent email. If necessary, you can quickly resend emails to recipients with just a few clicks, ensuring that important communications are never missed.

### Email Failure Notifications

Stay informed with SureMail's integration with SureTriggers, allowing you to customize your email failure notifications. Unlike other plugins that limit notifications to just a few channels, SureMail allows you to send alerts wherever you need—whether that’s email, Slack, SMS, or another channel—ensuring you’re always in the loop when emails fail to deliver.

### Detailed Email Analytics

Gain insights into your email sending performance with SureMail's detailed email analytics. Track delivery rates, failures, retries, and more, all from one easy-to-use dashboard. This data helps you identify patterns, optimize your sending practices, and ensure that your email deliverability is always at its best.

### Super Fast and Easy-to-Use Interface

SureMail is built with simplicity and speed in mind. It's super-fast, user-friendly interface makes setting up and managing your SMTP connections and email settings a breeze. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, SureMail’ intuitive design ensures that you can quickly configure and manage your email system without any technical hassles.

Whether you’re using Amazon SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, or Gmail, SureMail ensures smooth integration with these services, providing you with a powerful, fail-proof email delivery system. Choose from the best providers to suit your needs and ensure reliable email sending every time.
